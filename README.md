# Hollywood Movie Ratings Prediction

### üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è¬†Goals
- Through castings, I tried to create a model that predicts movie ratings and revenue
- Understand the influences and impacts of castings in Hollywood movies
- Made prediction using RNN,LSTM,GRU (based on Time Series)

### ùåû Data Collection & Preprocessing
* STEP 1
  - Used 2020-2021 IMDB Dataset (gathered information about movie title/runtime/ratings)
* STEP 2
  - Web crawled revenue data for each movie from Box Office Mojo website
* STEP 3
  - Gathered data about castings for each movie using IMDB 'title.principals' (since the data were extremely large, I used PySpark)
  - Mapped 'title.principals' with 'movie.id' to match castings with movies   
* STEP 4
  - Created 'past performance metrics' to display the ability of each casts
  - Data Features

* STEP 5
  - Merged 'past performance metric' that was calculated in step4 with basic movie infos
  - The final performance metric was calculated per movie by adding the 'past performance metric' of the entire casts within each movie.

### üìç Takeaway
* In deep learning model, Random Forest Regressor scored the lowest RMSE
* In time series model, LSTM scored the lowest RMSE
